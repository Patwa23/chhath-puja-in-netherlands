            <h2>Festival Dates: October 25 to October 28, 2025</h2>
            <p>Chhath Puja is a four-day ancient Hindu festival primarily celebrated in Bihar, Jharkhand, and Uttar Pradesh.</p>

            <h2>About Chhath Puja</h2>
            <p>Chhath Puja is a major Vedic festival dedicated to the **Sun God, Surya**, and **Chhathi Maiya** (a form of Goddess Usha). Devotees, particularly women (known as 'Vrati'), observe a rigorous 36-hour fast (often *Nirjala* - without water) and perform rituals to thank the Sun for sustaining life on Earth and to pray for the well-being, prosperity, and longevity of their families and children. It is unique as it is one of the few Hindu festivals where the setting sun is worshipped along with the rising sun.</p>

            <h2>The Four Days of Chhath Puja 2025</h2>

            <div class="day-description">
                <h3>Day 1: Nahay Khay (Saturday, October 25, 2025)</h3>
                <p>The festival begins with ritual bathing, usually in a holy river or pond, to purify the body and mind. Devotees then prepare and consume a single, pure **vegetarian meal**, typically including *Lauki Bhaat* (bottle gourd curry and rice), marking the last meal before the rigorous ritualistic fast begins.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="day-description">
                <h3>Day 2: Kharna / Lohanda (Sunday, October 26, 2025)</h3>
                <p>Devotees observe a strict fast without water from sunrise to sunset. In the evening, after offering prayers, they break the fast by eating *Kheer* (sweet rice pudding made with jaggery) and *Roti* (flatbread) as **Prasad**. The challenging 36-hour *Nirjala Vrat* (fast without food or water) then commences.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="day-description">
                <h3>Day 3: Sandhya Arghya (Monday, October 27, 2025)</h3>
                <p>This is the main day of the Puja. Devotees gather at the banks of a river or pond carrying elaborate offerings in bamboo baskets, including traditional sweets like **Thekua**, fruits, and sugarcane. They stand in the water and offer the first **Arghya** (offering of water and milk) to the **setting Sun** (Sandhya Arghya).</p>
            </div>

            <div class="day-description">
                <h3>Day 4: Usha Arghya & Parana (Tuesday, October 28, 2025)</h3>
                <p>The final day involves going back to the water body before dawn to offer the second **Arghya** to the **rising Sun** (Usha Arghya). After this final offering and prayer, the devotees break their arduous 36-hour fast. This ritual is known as **Parana** or **Puran**, officially concluding the Chhath Mahaparv.</p>
